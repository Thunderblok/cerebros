Sample Work Product Document

This is a sample work product document that demonstrates the type of content your AI assistant will learn from.

Project Overview:
The Thunderline project is an AI-powered platform for creating custom AI assistants. It uses Phoenix LiveView for the frontend and integrates with a Cerebros NAS (Neural Architecture Search) framework for training custom models.

Key Features:
1. Multi-step wizard interface for easy assistant creation
2. Document upload support for multiple formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
3. Background job processing with Oban
4. Text chunking into 512-character segments with overlap
5. CSV export for training data
6. Python RPC integration for Cerebros training

Technical Stack:
- Elixir 1.19+ with Phoenix Framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Ash Framework for resource management
- Oban for job queue
- Cerebros NAS for neural architecture search
- Python 3 for ML training

Document Processing Pipeline:
When you upload documents, the system:
1. Stores files in priv/nfs/agents/{agent_id}/{type}/
2. Extracts text based on file type
3. Chunks text into 512-char segments with 50-char overlap
4. Converts to CSV format
5. Enqueues Oban job for processing
6. Calls Python wrapper for Cerebros training

This allows your AI assistant to learn from your specific work style, communication patterns, and domain expertise.
